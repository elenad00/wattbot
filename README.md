# Wattbot
## Welcome to Wattbot
Welcome to Wattbot, your friendly Wattpad robot that assesses your progress in the grand Wattpad world! 
Created by Elena D in 2023.

## What Wattbot Tracks
Wattbot tracks the following for all of your current published stories:

* The stories likes
* The stories reads
* The stories chapters

Wattbot also generates the following metrics:

* The book's average likes per chapter
* The book's average number of reads to get a like
* Your interaction score; how your chapters, likes and reads interact. The higher the number, the better the interaction score

Wattbot can also calculate how many days you are away from your read goals based on your average daily reads for each book!

## How To Run Wattbot
You need access to my MongoDB database to run Wattbot yourself... sorry! However, the schema is pretty easy to make at home. You will also need your browser's header in order to make the queries to Wattpad's interface, otherwise it'll get pretty angry at you.
